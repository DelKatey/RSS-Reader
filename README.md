# RSS-Reader
Self Running Python RSS Reader script with an HTML page run through cgi-python to auto-redirect you to your next unread item.

Written to emulate the "Next Unread Item" feature of Google Reader (RIP)

feeds.txt goes in parent folder, as well as rssItems.pkl (pickle file with empty list in it)
